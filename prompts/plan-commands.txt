I have custom Agent Configurations for my project: hackathon-judge-optimizer, hackathon-code-reviewer, hackathon-debugger, hackathon-documenter, react-component-builder. I also have custom commands for feature-implementation and integration testing as described below. Â I plan to build our plan out in serial. We need  to plan each feature and define detailed arguments for each including schema, api, component details from the plan we generated. 
##feature-implementor.md
 Complete feature development for: $ARGUMENTS
@react-component-builder: Create necessary components
@hackathon-code-reviewer: Quick review for critical issues
@hackathon-debugger: Test integration and fix issues
@hackathon-documenter: Add feature documentation
Coordinate these steps for rapid feature completion.
