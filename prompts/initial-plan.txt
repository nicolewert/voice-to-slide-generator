I am in a hackathon where I must complete this project in 1 hour. We need expert level precision with identifying each task in the build. We need to prioritize speed and simplicity. We need a concise plan for implementing the project below with the stack listed. Do not write code or include project setup as we already have a starter template codebase that sets these up minimally. Â Please define clearly the endpoints and integrations that will be present and the db schemas we will need. Think mvp we want to win this hackathon!

* Components: shadcn/ui (New York style)
